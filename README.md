### Explanation

- **Screenshots Section:**  
  The sample image links use placeholder URLs (`via.placeholder.com`). Replace these with your actual image paths once you upload your images. One common approach is to add the images to an `assets` folder in your repository and reference them using relative paths (e.g., `assets/screenshot1.png`).

- **Project Structure:**  
  The structure provides clarity on where the frontend, Tauri backend, and assets reside.

- **Installation and Build Instructions:**  
  Clear steps guide the user from cloning the repository to running and building the application.
